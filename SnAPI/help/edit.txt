*|Edit|* Class
==========

Edit objects have no functions, they exist to group buffer modifications.

Edit objects are passed to |TextCommand|s, and can not be created by the user.
Using an invalid Edit object, or an Edit object from a different View, will
cause the functions that require them to fail.

This class is contained in the |sublime| module.
