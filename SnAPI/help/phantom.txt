*|Phantom|* Class
=============

Represents an HTML-based decoration to display non-editable content interspersed
in a View. Used with PhantomSet to actually add the phantoms to the View. Once a
Phantom has been constructed and added to the View, changes to the attributes
will have no effect.

This class is contained in the |sublime| module.


Constructors
------------

*Phantom*(region, content, layout, <on_navigate>)

  Creates a phantom attached to a region. The content is HTML to be processed
  by |minihtml|.

  layout must be one of:

  * `sublime.LAYOUT_INLINE`: Display the phantom in between the `region` and
    the point following.

  * `sublime.LAYOUT_BELOW`: Display the phantom in space below the current
    line, left-aligned with the `region`.

  * `sublime.LAYOUT_BLOCK`: Display the phantom in space below the current
    line, left-aligned with the beginning of the line.

  `on_navigate` is an optional callback that should accept a single string
  parameter, that is the `href` attribute of the link clicked.
