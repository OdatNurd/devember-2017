%hyperhelp title="HyperHelp Authoring Tools" date="2017-12-20"

This package provides some simple authoring tools for `hyperhelp` that simplify
the creation of help files, allowing you to focus on the content of the help
you provide for your package instead of focusing on how the system works.

HyperHelpAuthor provides you with commands for easily adding help to a package
by automatically creating the core directory structure and a minimal set of
help files to get you up and running.

Once you have some help files, additional functionality such as snippets and
automatic updating of help files comes into play to help you finish your help
masterpiece.
