*|Style	Conventions|*
=================

HyperHelp imposes some limitations on the layout of your help in order to
ensure that all help is presented in as consistent a manner as possible.

Word wrap is disabled, so all help should optimally be presentable in no more
than 80 characters. Although you are free to make your help as wide or as
narrow as you like, a single style is more cohesive for the user.

Indenting via tabs is discouraged (due to holy wars on the One True Tab Width)
by forcing tabs to be a single character and disabling tab-to-space
translations in help files.

This ensures that your help lays out the way you intended it to regardless of
the tab style employed by the end user of your help. Additionally although
various constructs do not allow spaces inside of them (for example |anchors|),
tabs are allowed.
