The *|main|* body of the help file is just plain text, like this stuff here.

You can create a *|key|* binding by including it in < and > characters. No
white space is allowed, so <Shift+PageUp> is OK, but <Shift+Page Up> is not.
It is also possible to use the > character in the binding, like <Alt+>>.

Simple raw *|code|* blocks like markdown are implemented, so you can create
`inline code blocks` if you like. Note that this is currently `not allowed to
wrap across lines`.

In order to create a *|link|*, you wrap text in a |pipe|. Spaces are
|not allowed| in the pipe section, so you have to use |snake_case| or
|this.style| to include multiple words.

Links and other navigation jumps to an *anchor*, which works the same way as a
|link| does (apart from semantic differences).

There is a second style of anchor called the *|hidden|* anchor, which will
still function as an anchor but not be visually displayed as such.

Currently all hidden anchors are modified to appear as plain text, but marked
with a region for verification that everything is working as expected.
