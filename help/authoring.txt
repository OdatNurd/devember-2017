%hyperhelp title="Authoring Help Files" date="2017-12-14"

This is a stub page for authoring text. This would be the main hub for pointing
out the commands that are available for help authoring.

This should also link off to other pages that provide information about the
format of help index files in the same way as the syntax file talks about the
markup allowed.

Once that's done, we can strip the explanatory comments out of the help
index.
