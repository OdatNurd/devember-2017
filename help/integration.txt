*|Integration|*
===========

One of the main design goals of HyperHelp is to be as easy as possible to
integrate into packages, to promote simple, easily accessible and useful help
for packages from directly within Sublime Text.

In the future, HyperHelp will be a dependency package that your package can
depend on. A simple change in the Package Control channel entry for your
package will be enough to ensure Package Control also installs HyperHelp if it
is not already installed.

Currently HyperHelp is under development as a part of Devember 2017. At the end
of December 2017 it will be split out back into the repository of the initial
prototype.

Until that time, the package is not ready for third parties to integrate yet
and features are still in a state of flux. However, you can check out the rest
of this sample help for more information on what is currently possible.
