%hyperhelp title="HyperHelp Help Syntax" date="2017-12-14"

Help files in HyperHelp are meant to be as plain text as possible to promote
the idea that the content of the help is more important than how pretty it
appears on your screen.

For this reason, help files generally have the `txt` extension to help indicate
to the user that they're just plain text. Outside of Sublime Text the help
files are easily viewable without requiring any special software.

Even so, there is minimal markup that you can use in order to provide some
structure and a little bit of extra visual emphasis to your help files.


*|File	Header|*
===========

Every HyperHelp help file should start with a header structured as follows:

    `%hyperhelp title="Help File Title" date="YYYY-MM-DD"`


When the help file is loaded into the |help	view|, the header will be converted
into a standard header line in the buffer. The title of the file is always
centered within the 80 column width of the help buffer, and the date is
displayed in a user-selectable format via the |hyperhelp_date_format| setting.

Although this header is not mandatory, it is highly recommended that your help
files always contain one so that all help displayed to the user is in a
consistent format.


*|Markup|*
======

Along with plain text, some simple markup is allowed in help files. This is
very light, since the idea is to get your help information across and not show
off your design and layout skills.

By design all markup is simple and contextual due to how syntax highlighting in
Sublime works. The goal is to provide only visual markup with as little
extraneous text as possible.

The allowable help markup includes the following items:


    *|Key	Bindings|*
    ------------

    Simple key bindings are supported, which are highlighted in the view to
    call attention to them. Key bindings are denoted by placing the binding
    inside of < and > characters, such as:

        <Shift+Page	Up>
        <Command+P>
        <Alt+Shift+>>


    Key bindings do not support interior space characters, but `Tab` characters
    are allowed.


    *|Code	Blocks|*
    -----------

    Simple code blocks such as those in markdown are implemented as a way to
    help you draw some simple contextual highlighting around key terms and
    elements.

    `Code Blocks` may contain whitespace, but must always start and end on the
    same line in order to be considered valid.


    *Anchors*
    ---------

    Anchors represent points of interest in help documents. HyperHelp natively
    allows you to jump through all of the anchors in the current help document
    by use of the <Tab> and <Shift+Tab> key bindings.

    Additionally, pressing <Enter> on a |link| will jump the cursor to the
    matching anchor point, even if it is in a different help document. This
    action is also available by a <Double	Left	Click> on a link.

    Anchors are defined by wrapping text in asterisks, such as the heading of
    this section of the documentation. Such anchors remain visible in the
    document to provide visual clues that it is a point of interest.

    Spaces are not allowed inside of anchor text, although `Tab` characters are
    allowed. Note that only interior tabs are supported; an anchor with a
    leading or trailing tab is not allowed.

    Alternatively you may also use other conventions as you see fit, such as
    *snake_case* or *periods.as_spaces* (or some other method that does not
    include whitespace).

    To allow for points of interest in documents that are not visually
    distinct, you can wrap the text of the anchor in pipe characters, such as
    `*|this sample|*`. Such anchors are treated the same as other anchors, but
    are not visually distinct.

    The other section headers in this part of the help are hidden anchors.


    *|Links|*
    -----

    Links are defined by wrapping the link text in pipe characters. The text in
    a link must match an anchor somewhere in the current help document or in
    some other help document.

    Links follow the same rules as |anchors| do in that white space is not
    allowed in link text but tabs are (except leading and trailing tabs).

				Some sample links are the above link to the Anchor section of the help, as
				well as this link to the |markup| section or the top level |Intro|
    section.


    *|Separators|*
    ----------

    Separators allow you to draw lines and boxes in help, such as to underline
    section headings (as is done in this sample help).

    Vertical separators consist of a `|` character that is preceded or
    succeeded with a tab character. This distinguishes them from the characters
    used to define links, which are not allowed to have leading or trailing tab
    characters.

    Horizontal separators consist of four or more consecutive `=` or `-`
    characters. Additionally the sequence can begin with an `+` character and
    end with a `+` or `|` character.

    This allows you to do things like underline section headers (as in this
    sample help file) or draw boxes:


        +------------|----------+
        |	Sample Box	| Column 2	|
        +============+==========+
