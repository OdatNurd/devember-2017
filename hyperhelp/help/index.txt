*|What	is	HyperHelp|*
=================

HyperHelp is a package that provides a simple text based help system to Sublime
Text. If you consider the spectrum of package documentation to run from
creating a simple text file (e.g. a `README` file) to creating a complete
documentation site in HTML, HyperHelp falls somewhere between the two.

The system employed by HyperHelp uses plain text files to provide help content
(with some minimal |markup| allowed) but provides some of the power of web
based documentation by allowing you to navigate easily from help file to help
file and topic to topic.


*|How	it	works|*
============

Help files in HyperHelp are plain text with a small amount of |markup| allowed
to add some visual distinction as well as to allow navigation by way of
|anchors| and |links|.

`Anchors` are set navigation points within help files that the help user can
navigate between, and define |topics|. As you might expect, `links` allow the
user to shift the help display to any `anchor`.

In order to be as easy to use as possible, HyperHelp is almost entirely
transparent to both package authors that want to add help to their packages, as
well as the end user of the help system.

This means that as a package developer you only need to follow the simple steps
in |integration.txt| to ensure that HyperHelp will be available to your package
users, and then focus on writing your help.

Once you've followed the integration steps, you can use Sublime itself to create
your help content, or use the `HyperHelpAuthor` package to help you create the
appropriate files.

More information on creating help files can be found in |authoring.txt|.
