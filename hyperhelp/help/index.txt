*|What	Is	HyperHelp|*
=================

This package provides a very simple help system for use inside of Sublime Text,
with a goal of being focused on content over presentation (that is, with little
|markup|) and an ease of |integration| with packages.

The main body of most help files is just plain text, which is simply readable
and allows for the standard operations users are used to in Sublime text, such
as being able to search inside the help, copy help information out, and so on.

For this reason HTML markup (via phantoms) is not supported currently, although
support for simple in-line images is planned.


*|How	it	works|*
============

In order to be as easy to use as possible, HyperHelp is almost entirely
transparent to both package authors that want to add help to their packages, as
well as the end user of the help system.

This means that as a package developer you only need to follow the simple steps
in |integration.txt| to ensure that HyperHelp will be available, and then focus
on writing your help.

There are two main types of files that tie together in order to create a full
help system within your package:

    1. A |Help	Index| file that provides information on the help files that
      make up your help system.

    2. One or more help files that provide the actual help. Help files use some
       simple |markup| to provide some simple structure and emphasis to your
       help text.


Creating a single file of each type in your package is enough to have your
help appear within HyperHelp. More information on this process can be found in
|authoring.txt|.


*|Integration	with	Packages|*
=========================

HyperHelp is designed to be easy to integrate into your package so that you can
focus on writing help and not worry about the interior details.

HyperHelp is not just for package authors! As a Sublime Text user, you may find
that there are bits and pieces of text that you find yourself always referring
to that you would like to be able to browse.

Help can be added to your `User` package just as easily as to any other,
allowing you full control over your own personal help system.

More information on how to set up a package to support HyperHelp can be found
in |integration.txt|.
