*|Authoring	Overview|*
==================

In order to provide help for a package, there are two key types of files that
need to be provided, a |help	index| and a |help	source|.  Each package that
provides help must contain an index, which tells HyperHelp about the help that
is available in that package. Additionally, one or more help files need to be
provided in order to provide the actual help content.

Both types of files are simple text files, with the index being a specially
structures |JSON| file and the source files being plain text along with some
simple |markup|.


*|Help	Index|*
----------

This section would talk about the structure of the help index and the required
keys. It should link to a file with more complete information and an example.


*|Table	of	Contents|*
-----------------

This section would talk about the table of contents sections of the help index
to tell you what it's for. It should also be a separate file with more complete
information.


*|Help	Source|*
-----------

This section would talk about help files. I think it's enough to discuss them
briefly and then link to the |markup| page, since that tells you the structure
of these files.


*|Topics|*
------

This section would talk about topics and how they are created by |anchors| and
navigated to by keyboard and by |links|. This should also perhaps link to an
extra file that talks about the structure of a topic, which the above topics
could link to.

This should also discuss how to set up |externals| as well.


*|Aliases|*
-------

This section is just a simple explanation that aliases provide an extra name
for help topics that are equivalent, so that you can alter the link text used
and still target a specific |anchor|.
