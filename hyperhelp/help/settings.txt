%hyperhelp title="HyperHelp Settings" date="2017-12-31"

There are a small handful of settings that you can use to alter how HyperHelp
works to customize it to your needs better. As HyperHelp is a dependency
package, the settings should go in |your	user	preferences| file.


*|hyperhelp_date_format|*
---------------------

This setting controls the format of the last modification date that appears in
the header line of all help files. Changes to this setting will be applied when
the next help file is loaded.

The default value for this is setting is `%x`, which sets a date format that's
appropriate for the area of the world in which you live.

You can use any of the format specifiers given in the |Python	3.3	docs| on the
|strftime()	and	strptime()	behavior| page.

Note however that no time stamps are stored for file times, only dates. As such
you should avoid any fields that tell you the time of the day.
