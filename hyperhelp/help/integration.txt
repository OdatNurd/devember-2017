*|Integration|*
===========

One of the core design goals of HyperHelp is to be as easy as possible to
integrate with any package in order to promote a simple, easily accessible and
useful help system that provided consistency for users.

In the future, HyperHelp will be a dependency package that your package can
depend on. This requires a simple change to the entry for your package in the
Package Control Channel in order to ensure that Package Control installs
HyperHelp if it is not already installed.

There will also be a small amount of boiler plate bootstrap code to include
somewhere in your package in order to ensure that everything is set up as it
should be.

For the time being, HyperHelp is still in active development, and so it is
still being developed as a regular package in order to facilitate development.

This file will be modified to include the full integration instructions when
development has proceeded far enough to warrant it.

In the meantime, HyperHelp remains a user facing package. You can still use it
to create help for your package; while it remains a regular package it is
always available with no bootstrapping required.
