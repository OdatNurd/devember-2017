This project constitutes my entry into Devember 2017. See <http://devember.org>
for more information. There is an associated development log at
<http://bloggity.nurdz.com/category/devember2017/> as per the rules of Devember.

The repository will contain tags which represent the state of everything at the
each of day day of Devember (including an initial tag), allowing for easy
tracking of all changes made from day to day.

For this Devember I will be recreating and redesigning one of my Sublime Text
projects <https://github.com/OdatNurd/hyperhelp> from the bottom up. If you're
interested in that project, that is where the development from this repository
will end up once Devember has wrapped.

hyperhelp is a Sublime Text 3 package dependency that aims to provide all of the
core work needed to allow a package to quickly and easily provide in-editor
context specific help, such as what is provided by the help system in the
[Vim Editor](http://www.vim.org/).
